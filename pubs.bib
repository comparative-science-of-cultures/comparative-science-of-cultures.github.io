  abstract     = {The classical account of the Brahmin priestly class and its role in Indian religion has seen
remarkable continuity during the past two centuries. Its core claims appear to remain unaffected,
despite the major shifts that occurred in the theorizing of Indian culture and in the study of religion.
In this article, we first examine the issue of the power and status of the Brahmin and show how it
generates explanatory puzzles today. We then turn to 18th- and 19th-century sources to identify the
cognitive conditions which sustained the classical account of the Brahmin priest and allowed for its
transmission. Three clusters of concepts were crucial here: Christian-theological ideas concerning
heathen priesthood and idolatry; racial notions of biological and cultural superiority and inferiority;
and anthropological speculations about ‘primitive man’ and his ‘magical thinking’. While all three
clusters were rejected by 20th- and 21st-century scholarship, the related claims about Brahmanical
ritual power continue to be presented as facts. What accounts for this peculiar combination of
continuities and discontinuities in the study of (ancient) Indian religion? We turn to some insights
from the philosophy of science to sketch a route toward answering this question.},

  abstract     = {By arguing that a new ‘School’ is crystallising in the study of India, Deborah Sutton (2018) has brought to the surface phenomena that are typical of any encounter between competing research traditions. Some difficulties of understanding are caused by conceptual change: in the dominant research tradition, ‘Hinduism’ and ‘the caste system’ refer to structures that exist in Indian society; in the research programme developed by Balagangadhara, these terms designate experiential entities embedded in a western cultural experience of India. This conceptual divide also extends to the empirical: because the study of caste and Hinduism is collapsing under the weight of accumulated anomalies, certain problems are crucial to the alternative theorising of the Ghent School, whereas they seem irrelevant to the dominant tradition. Sutton engages in the polemics characteristic of confrontations between competing research traditions. She distorts and domesticates unfamiliar ideas from this School by mapping them onto notions familiar to her. Consequently, she confuses Balagangadhara’s hypotheses about colonial consciousness with hackneyed stories about ‘Orientalism’. The article concludes with a puzzle: Why does Sutton recognise a group of researchers as a new School, while trying to dismiss them as ‘acolytes’ who reproduce the ‘mantras’ and ‘dogmas’ of an Indian thinker?},

  abstract     = {In the currently dominant discourse about Indian society, the caste system appears as an immoral social structure: its principles represent immoral behaviour as moral obligation. The chapter raises the question as to how this inherently implausible conception of the caste system crystallised in the European understanding of India. It argues that the Old Testament account of the Jewish nation and religion became the framework for describing the people and religion of 'the Gentiles' or 'Hindus' in India. The Hindus were viewed as a nation divided into a hierarchy of tribes and united by one religion led by the tribe of the priesthood. In the course of the nineteenth century, Protestant authors then came to the conclusion that caste was a religious institution: dominated by Brahmin priests, this institution imposed the civil laws of a nation as religious obligations of divine origin. If we were to discard the overtly biblical elements from the nineteenth-century missionary descriptions of Hinduism and caste, it would become difficult to distinguish them from the contemporary moral discourse.},

  abstract     = {For several decades now, commentators have sounded the alarm about ‘the crisis of secularism’. Saving the secular state from political religion, they suggest, is a question of survival for societies characterized by religious diversity. Yet it remains unclear what the crisis is all about. This book argues that its roots are internal to the liberal model of secularism and toleration. Rather than being neutral or non-religious, this is a secularized theological model with deep religious roots. The limits of liberal secularism go back to its emergence from the inherent dynamics and tensions of the Protestant Reformation in Europe. From the very beginning, this political model went hand in hand with its own modes of intolerance: an anticlerical theology that rejected Catholicism and Judaism as evil forms of ‘political religion’. In the name of public order, all religions and traditions in European societies had to reform themselves along the lines of a secularized Protestant framework. Later this normative framework gave rise to the orientalist and colonial descriptions of ‘Hinduism’ (and its ‘caste hierarchy’) as a false and immoral religion. Drawing on these descriptions, secularism was then presented as the only route forward for India, even though it often harms local forms of living together and reinforces conflicts rather than resolving them. Today’s advocacy of secularism is not the outcome of reasonable reflection on the problems of Indian society but a manifestation of a colonial consciousness that blinds us to cultural realities.},

The Orientalist discourse on India is approached as a body of reflections on the western cultural experience of India. This perspective brings us to the thesis that the pre-conditions for the emergence of the AIT lay in the postulation of two entities in the Orientalist discourse on India: the ‘Hindu religion’ and its ‘caste system’. Both these notions and the AIT appeared cogent and coherent to European minds, because they mirrored internal developments within European culture and its intellectual debates, which had given shape to Europe’s experience of India.},

At the turn of the twentieth century, this concern vanished from the radar of Western scholarship: all known peoples and societies, it was concluded, had some form of religion. This essay examines the relevant debates from the sixteenth to the twentieth century: Why was this issue so important? How did European thinkers determine whether or not some people had religion? What allowed them to close this debate? It will be shown that European descriptions of the “religions” of non-Western cultures counted as evidence for or against theoretical claims made within a particular framework, namely that of generic Christian theology. The issue of the universality of religion was settled not by scientific research but by making ad hoc modifications to this theological framework whenever it faced empirical anomalies. This is important today, because the debate concerning the cultural universality of religion has been reopened. On the one hand, evolutionary-biological explanations of religion claim that religion must be a cultural universal, since its origin lies in the evolution of the human species; on the other hand, authors suggest that religion is not a cultural universal, because many of the “religions” of humanity are fictitious entities created within an underlying theological framework.},

This review offers a close analysis of this puzzle and then connects it to the historical process whereby the internal dynamics of western Christianity gave shape to normative political theory. Normative political models have a peculiar relation to the empirical world. At any point, one can judge the factual empirical situation in a liberal democracy - no matter what that factual situation is - as deficient vis-a-vis norms like equality, freedom of expression, religious freedom and separation of church and state. The trouble is that we do not know what the 'complete' fulfillment of these norms would look like. Still, these norms propel political analysis: as Abeysekara notes, classical and postcolonial studies of conflict in Sri Lanka build on a set of deep-seated norms about 'difference,' 'unity' and 'humanism,' which have emerged from the Christian dynamic of universalization that laid the foundations of liberal political theory.},

To answer this question, this essay examines the Indian secularism debate and develops a hypothesis on the process whereby liberal principles crystallized in the West and then spread elsewhere. It argues that the secularization of western political thought has not produced independent rational principles, but rather transformed theological ideas into the "topoi" of a culture. Like all such topoi, the principles of liberalism depend on other clusters of metaphysical ideas present in western societies. When they migrate to new settings, the absence of these surrounding ideas presents fundamental obstacles to the interpretation and elaboration of liberal principles. The case of Indian secularism illustrates the cultural limitations of liberal political theory, rather than showing its universal significance.},

  abstract     = {In The Colonial Construction of What?, Jakob De Roover and Sarah Claerhout raise three fundamental questions to clear the conceptual ground required for theory formation on the construction of Hinduism. First, they analyze the question ‘Is religion a construct?’ The claim that religion is only a conceptual tool of the scholar, which does not refer to any empirical reality, they argue, fails to make sense in the absence of a theory of religion. However, this does not imply it is nonsensical to speak of the construction of Hinduism. ‘Is Hinduism a construct?’ is answered in the positive, but qualified in a limited empirical sense. Subsequently, they raise the question as to ‘What is constructed in the process of construction?’ On the one hand, one could suggest that Hinduism has come into being as an object, a new religion that materialized on the subcontinent. On the other hand, one could argue, as De Roover and Claerhout do, that Hinduism has been created as a conceptual unit in certain descriptions of India only. These descriptions have had impact upon Indian society, but this does not entail that Hindu religion exists in India today.},

  abstract     = {Early modern political thought transformed toleration from a prudential consideration into a moral obligation. Three questions need to be answered by any explanation of this transition: Did religious toleration really become an obligation of the state in this period? If this was the case, how could tolerating heresy and idolatry possibly become a moral duty to Christians? How could Europeans both condemn practices as idolatrous and immoral, and yet insist that these practices ought to be tolerated? To answer these questions, the article shows how the early policy of toleration in British India was constituted by a Protestant theological framework. Toleration turned into a moral obligation, it is argued, because the Reformation had identified liberty in the religious realm as God’s will for humanity. This gave rise to a dynamic in which Christian states and churches were continuously challenged for their violations of religious liberty. The principle of toleration developed as a part of this dynamic.},

@article{429418,
  abstract     = {Recently, scholars have disputed whether Locke's political theory should be read as the groundwork of secular liberalism or as a Protestant political theology. Focusing on Locke's mature theory of toleration, the article raises a central question: What if these two readings are compatible? That is, what would be the consequences if Locke's political philosophy has theological foundations, but has also given shape to secular liberalism? Examining Locke's theory in the Letter Concerning Toleration (1689), the article argues that this is indeed the case. The liberal model of toleration is a secularization of the theology of Christian liberty and its division of society into a temporal political kingdom and the spiritual kingdom of Christ. Therefore, when liberal toleration travels beyond the boundaries of the Christian West or when western societies become multicultural, it threatens to lose its intelligibility.},
