  abstract	= {Because the notion of 'relevance' is deeply context bound,
		  I argue that we need to broaden our understanding of
		  development to include 'conditions for development'. In
		  this paper, I reflect on the well-known adage about 'give a
		  fish' and 'teach to fish' by adding the following: 'create
		  the conditions for fishing, we will fish forever'. At the
		  beginning of the 21st century, wich is also an era of rapid
		  globalization, I reflect on (a) what it means to speak of
		  development work (b) in a continent like Asia, wich has
		  emerging industrial giants like China and India, both of
		  whom know extremely lopsided development. Within this
		  framework, I think about what it means to speak of
		  developmentally relevant research. Without losing sight of
		  the hard-won understanding of developmental work acquired
		  over the decade, I plead that we look at development as a
		  multi-layered process. If we do so, we can appriciate the
		  fact that different kinds of research are relevant at
		  different levels: what is relevant at one level does not
		  need to be relevant at another. Thus, criteria for
		  developmentally relevant research will have to keep these
		  different levels seperate from each other. To answer the
		  four questions posed by the taks force, I suggest that we
		  split the global problem about 'developmentally relevant
		  research' into three tractable subproblems, each of which
		  giving a different answer at an appropriate level.},

  abstract	= {Ananda Abeysekara's work revolves around the 'aporia of
		  our democratic existence.' This review offers a close
		  analysis of this puzzle and then connects it to the
		  historical process whereby the internal dynamics of western
		  Christianity gave shape to normative political theory.
		  Normative political models have a peculiar relation to the
		  empirical world. At any point, one can judge the factual
		  empirical situation in a liberal democracy - no matter what
		  that factual situation is - as deficient vis-a-vis norms
		  like equality, freedom of expression, religious freedom and
		  separation of church and state. The trouble is that we do
		  not know what the 'complete' fulfillment of these norms
		  would look like. Still, these norms propel political
		  analysis: as Abeysekara notes, classical and postcolonial
		  studies of conflict in Sri Lanka build on a set of
		  deep-seated norms about 'difference,' 'unity' and
		  'humanism,' which have emerged from the Christian dynamic
		  of universalization that laid the foundations of liberal
		  political theory.},

		  the structure of the Christian and the Indian spirituality.
		  Drawing attention to their dissimilarities, it attempts to
		  reformulate the differences among the Indian traditions in
		  a novel way. It argues that cultures and traditions are not
		  just different; rather that they differ from each other in
		  different ways as well. The future of religious studies, it
		  is suggested, is dependent on developing the ability to
		  develop new ways of describing the differences between
		  cultures and traditions. This is the agenda for the future.
		  As a correlate to this task, the article suggests that we
		  replace the question "who speaks 'for' and 'about' a
		  religion?" with a more pregnant and a more accurate
		  reformulation: "how to speak for a religion in the

		  religious conversion in India, his viewpoints have not been
		  systematically analyzed. One reason is that his writings
		  present a confounding blend of concepts derived from
		  different traditions. The article argues that this fact
		  provides a unique entry point into Gandhi’s thought. By
		  looking for systematic patterns in his distortive use of
		  English-language terms and ideas, the background ideas that
		  have structured his reasoning can be traced. The conceptual
		  distortions in Gandhi’s writings are shaped by these
		  ideas, which reflect typical Indian attitudes and modes of
		  thought on the question of religion and conversion.
		  Analyzing his writings in this way not only allows for an
		  explanation of his views on religion and his antagonism to
		  conversion, but also clarifies the widespread unease
		  towards Christian proselytism in contemporary India.},

  abstract	= {For centuries, the question whether there were peoples
		  without religion was the subject of heated debate among
		  European thinkers. At the turn of the twentieth century,
		  this concern vanished from the radar of Western
		  scholarship: all known peoples and societies, it was
		  concluded, had some form of religion. This essay examines
		  the relevant debates from the sixteenth to the twentieth
		  century: Why was this issue so important? How did European
		  thinkers determine whether or not some people had religion?
		  What allowed them to close this debate? It will be shown
		  that European descriptions of the “religions” of
		  non-Western cultures counted as evidence for or against
		  theoretical claims made within a particular framework,
		  namely that of generic Christian theology. The issue of the
		  universality of religion was settled not by scientific
		  research but by making ad hoc modifications to this
		  theological framework whenever it faced empirical
		  anomalies. This is important today, because the debate
		  concerning the cultural universality of religion has been
		  reopened. On the one hand, evolutionary-biological
		  explanations of religion claim that religion must be a
		  cultural universal, since its origin lies in the evolution
		  of the human species; on the other hand, authors suggest
		  that religion is not a cultural universal, because many of
		  the “religions” of humanity are fictitious entities
		  created within an underlying theological framework.},

@Book{		  5934730,
  abstract	= {For several decades now, commentators have sounded the
		  alarm about ‘the crisis of secularism’. Saving the
		  secular state from political religion, they suggest, is a
		  question of survival for societies characterized by
		  religious diversity. Yet it remains unclear what the crisis
		  is all about. This book argues that its roots are internal
		  to the liberal model of secularism and toleration. Rather
		  than being neutral or non-religious, this is a secularized
		  theological model with deep religious roots. The limits of
		  liberal secularism go back to its emergence from the
		  inherent dynamics and tensions of the Protestant
		  Reformation in Europe. From the very beginning, this
		  political model went hand in hand with its own modes of
		  intolerance: an anticlerical theology that rejected
		  Catholicism and Judaism as evil forms of ‘political
		  religion’. In the name of public order, all religions and
		  traditions in European societies had to reform themselves
		  along the lines of a secularized Protestant framework.
		  Later this normative framework gave rise to the orientalist
		  and colonial descriptions of ‘Hinduism’ (and its
		  ‘caste hierarchy’) as a false and immoral religion.
		  Drawing on these descriptions, secularism was then
		  presented as the only route forward for India, even though
		  it often harms local forms of living together and
		  reinforces conflicts rather than resolving them. Today’s
		  advocacy of secularism is not the outcome of reasonable
		  reflection on the problems of Indian society but a
		  manifestation of a colonial consciousness that blinds us to
		  cultural realities.},

  abstract	= {Recent scholarship claims to have revealed the problematic
		  nature of the religious-secular distinction: (1) the
		  distinction is slippery or fluid; (2) the meanings of the
		  words "religious" and "secular" have changed over multiple
		  historical contexts; (3) the distinction is a binary; (4)
		  it is essentialist in nature. Analyzing these objections,
		  the article shows that it is very difficult to find a clear
		  problem statement. To whom is the religious-secular
		  distinction a problem and why? The distinction was
		  originally made within Christian theology, where it
		  concerned a triad rather than a binary: true religion,
		  false religions, and the secular. The notion of the secular
		  always required the presence of the opposition between
		  truth and falsity in religion, because it was the sphere
		  that remained after true and false religion had been
		  demarcated. In this sense, the secular had a " dark side,"
		  namely, idolatry or false religion. To a Christian
		  believer, there is no conceptual problem involved in making
		  the religious-secular distinction, because his or her
		  theology helps him specify what true and false religion are
		  and, as a consequence, what the secular is. However,
		  because of its neutrality in religious matters, the liberal
		  state has tried to reduce the theological triad to a binary
		  opposition between religion and the secular. The inevitable
		  failure of this attempt has created a formless secular
		  sphere that is haunted by its dark side: the notion of
		  false religion.},

		  the caste system appears as an immoral social structure:
		  its principles represent immoral behaviour as moral
		  obligation. The chapter raises the question as to how this
		  inherently implausible conception of the caste system
		  crystallised in the European understanding of India. It
		  argues that the Old Testament account of the Jewish nation
		  and religion became the framework for describing the people
		  and religion of 'the Gentiles' or 'Hindus' in India. The
		  Hindus were viewed as a nation divided into a hierarchy of
		  tribes and united by one religion led by the tribe of the
		  priesthood. In the course of the nineteenth century,
		  Protestant authors then came to the conclusion that caste
		  was a religious institution: dominated by Brahmin priests,
		  this institution imposed the civil laws of a nation as
		  religious obligations of divine origin. If we were to
		  discard the overtly biblical elements from the
		  nineteenth-century missionary descriptions of Hinduism and
		  caste, it would become difficult to distinguish them from
		  the contemporary moral discourse.},

@Article{	  8602938,
  abstract	= {By arguing that a new ‘School’ is crystallising in the
		  study of India, Deborah Sutton (2018) has brought to the
		  surface phenomena that are typical of any encounter between
		  competing research traditions. Some difficulties of
		  understanding are caused by conceptual change: in the
		  dominant research tradition, ‘Hinduism’ and ‘the
		  caste system’ refer to structures that exist in Indian
		  society; in the research programme developed by
		  Balagangadhara, these terms designate experiential entities
		  embedded in a western cultural experience of India. This
		  conceptual divide also extends to the empirical: because
		  the study of caste and Hinduism is collapsing under the
		  weight of accumulated anomalies, certain problems are
		  crucial to the alternative theorising of the Ghent School,
		  whereas they seem irrelevant to the dominant tradition.
		  Sutton engages in the polemics characteristic of
		  confrontations between competing research traditions. She
		  distorts and domesticates unfamiliar ideas from this School
		  by mapping them onto notions familiar to her. Consequently,
		  she confuses Balagangadhara’s hypotheses about colonial
		  consciousness with hackneyed stories about
		  ‘Orientalism’. The article concludes with a puzzle: Why
		  does Sutton recognise a group of researchers as a new
		  School, while trying to dismiss them as ‘acolytes’ who
		  reproduce the ‘mantras’ and ‘dogmas’ of an Indian
		  thinker?},
